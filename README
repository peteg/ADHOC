ADHOC is an EDSL for describing synchronous systems. Its chief
novelties are:

- the use of Arrows
- support for combinationally-cyclic circuits
- support for knowledge conditionals
- a version of Gerard Berry's Esterel language

It also contains a simple model checker and counterexample generator
for CTL (and a simple semantics for knowledge).
